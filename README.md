# Portfolio Projects

This repository showcases two key projects built using Django and Django Rest Framework:

### 1. Military Map Web App
A real-time collaborative mapping application designed for military operations. The app integrates geolocation tracking, WebSocket-based real-time communication, and secure role-based access control to replicate a C4ISR system for mission coordination.

[See the demo version](https://chanaps.com)

### 2. Kanban Board (CS50W Final Project)
A task management application inspired by the Kanban methodology, allowing users to create, manage, and track tasks. It features a RESTful API for dynamic front-end interactions and efficient task updates.

Both projects demonstrate full-stack development skills with a focus on back-end design, security, and real-time data handling.
